        Hi, My name is Daniel Schmidt and I am a recent college graduate with a degree in Computer Science. I am interested in many areas of Computer Science and programming, but am most interested in developing web applications and general software development. I have about 3 years of programming experience with my most comfortable languages being Java/ C++ but have recently been learning Php and am fairly practiced on it as well. I also have experience with HTML, JavaScript, Jquery, and CSS as well. I also have some Java web development experience as well and made a simple chat application using JavaEE using web sockets. My main interests include coding, video games, the outdoors, and reading. I am a hard worker and am always willing to go out of my way to get the job done and do it well, which is why I think I would be a good match for this position.
